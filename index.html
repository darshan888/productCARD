        Wireshark is the world’s foremost and widely-used network protocol analyzer. It lets you see what’s happening on your network at a microscopic level and is the de facto (and often de jure) standard
         across many commercial and non-profit enterprises, government agencies, and educational institutions

        Wireshark development thrives thanks to the volunteer contributions of networking experts around the 
        globe and is the continuation of a project started by Gerald Combs in 1998.
